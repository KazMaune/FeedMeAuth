# Local Setup
- You need to right click on application.properties.example and copy it
- Next you need to right click on our resources folder and paste it in
- When you do this it will pop open a menu to rename the file, when it does remove the .example from the name
- Put your edamam app id and app key in their respective places
- Would recommend saving your finished application.properties in a .txt file for ease of use in the future
